							<h2 className="display-5 fw-bold mb-4">How SriKari was started?</h2>
							<p>
								Started in the form of Srikari worship, was initiated by guruji in 2009, earlier Srikari was performed as an external ritual worship at individual houses in
								gatherings involving all members of a particular household followed up by bhajans and dance.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Srikari</b> had once become a festivity through the word of mouth which occupied the hearts of families and was regularly performed at times when there were
								happy moments such as birth of a child, birthday’s, success in business ventures etc and Srikari was also performed for uplifting lives of householders who were
								bearing through bad times due to losses.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Srikari</b>was welcome as any other festival that had paved way into the lives of thousands of volunteers and devotees along with their family members to welcome
								abundance into their lives.
							</p>

							<p>
								Over the years from its inception, Srikari had become so popular that performing it for individual families had become too tedious to handle and then guruji worked
								a way for bringing Srikari to everyone in the year 2016 for those who desire to undergo it, by bringing them all together to one place once during the year to
								participate , perform and do sankalpa on their own through meditation and other methods in a celebrative environment and still reap full benefits just as is
								begotten from an external worship.

							<p>
								For fulfillment of all things in life there’s only one thing that can open all the doors to possibility and for that yoga specifies meditation and meditation alone
								which is the well known subjective journey within, Sankalpa Siddhi meditation is one such guided journey to manifest your intentions.
							</p>

							<p>
								Transcending the states of wakefulness, dream and deep sleep states of Consciousness and diving into the fourth state of consciousness which is also known as the
								transcendental consciousness is the state of all possibilities.{" "}
							</p>

							<p>
								When you progress in meditation, unfolding the 4th state of consciousness with complete awareness and sow the seed of your intention in that state of consciousness
								called sankalpa, is known to be difficult of practices, when attained germinates and grows into a serene tree.
							</p>

							<p>
								This process of taking someone there and especially an audience so big is a mind bending task, you are guided and driven into that state of consciousness carrying
								your intentions which will be sown by you in your own transcendental state of mind and made manifest by guruji at the event in the fullness of joy, dance, happiness
								and celebrative environment.

							<p>
								The manifestation happens due to a bona-fide communication with the universal consciousness i.e. the cosmic mother Tripureshwari, there are four types of
								communication which is mentioned in the yogic science and vedas, the same is found mentioned in the Lalita Sahasranamam verse 81 that reads{" "}

							<h2 className="display-5 fw-bold mb-4 special-title">||Parapratyak chitirupa pashyanti paradevata Madhyama vaikharirupa bhakta manasa hamsika|| LS 81</h2>

							<p>
								Meaning the communication with the divine is possible in 4 ways , first is by speech , second is through feelings, third is through visualization and the fourth is
								a very powerful way of communication which is PARA meaning that which happens in the transcendental state of consciousness, the four ways are named Vikhari meaning
								speech, Madhyama meaning feelings, Pashyanti meaning visualization and Para which literally means transcendental state of consciousness.
