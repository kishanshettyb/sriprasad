								all he could and so does his old father, after a while an old Natha Sadhu passes on the same route while witnessing the event he walks close the lady and says you
								are going to blessed with a fruit(prasada) and soon after he walks past the trees and disappears the cashew fruit comes crashing down, the lady reveres it as a
								blessing and eats the fruit and they all finish their visit to the temple and return to their house after which a boy will be born of the couple and so the boys dad
								names him Prasada.

							<p>
								His first lesson in spirituality came from his father at the age of 5, who was a practitioner of BKS Iyengar Yoga who had then introduced him to Hatha yoga, having
								quested a long way he was actively involved in civil community services throughout his adolescence such as Scouts, NCC and has staged various Street plays to
								protest and bring awareness to the general public.
							</p>
							<p>
								Having born to a Hindu family he would perform religious practices with his mother, being brought up in an Islamic neighborhood he had learnt and practiced Islamic
								teachings, gaining insight into the knowledge of Quran, his involvement in Christianity came from his schooling in a Christian institution where he would attend
								Church gatherings to gain knowledge from Bible. His mother was an orthodoxly religious person while his father a practical man who mostly believed in social service
								than performing rituals. Being born a Hindu and having experienced diverse religions he had learnt to selflessly serve humanity from his father and found the inner
								meaning and purpose behind the religious rituals from his mother.{" "}
							</p>
							<p>
								On one such occasion during his summer holidays after he had completed his 10th grade examination he gets a call from his NCC and Painting master who instructs him
								to head to Kaveri Ashram while he was living in Veerajpet, Coorg that he go a paint a logo of Sri Ramakrishna Mutt in the ashram's podium and after he finishes the
								ashram chief greets him and asks him to come back to the same place on a particular date and they have planned to honor him with a gift, he arrives back at the
								ashram on the said date to witness scores of people in the ashram and soon after a program takes start and the young boy Sri Prasad will be called on to the stage
								and will be presented a Bhagavat Gita book, after the program the chief of ashram a Swamiji of highest rank speaks of a discourse from chapter 4 of Bhagavat Gita,
								there he speaks of what a god is like, he says at every interval in time he will be born again and again, even Lord Krishna is one such avatar and as per Bhagavat
								Gita Krishna himself says that he will born back as Kalki which is another avatar of the Lord Vishnu, he further quotes how Krishna tells Arjuna that he has
								propounded the Gita to Brahma, Surya, Manu, Ikshvaku and so on, then Arjuna ask Krishna how could you do so when they were in existence several 100s and 1000s of
								years ago, for which Lord Krishna replies that though I am born now, I remember all of my previous births and that is not possible with you Arjuna. The chief of the
								ashram interprets this as, this universal consciousness is born as Rama, Krishna, Jesus, Moses, Ibrahim, Guru Nanak and even Mahatma Gandhi, now after listening to
								this Sri Prasad had gained real gift of his life, it was a grand opening to his quest for truth, which otherwise he was convinced that Jesus is true messenger of
								god who is the son of the Lord as per his Christian learnings, another message had put him in great dilemma which is from Islamic teachings that there is no other
								that befits a god other than allah and more so when he came home to see several pictures of deities in the puja house. He started learning from the Gita and in BG
								he comes across Prasthana Triya which says how a spiritual aspirant must know 3 scriptures, they are 10 Upanishads, Bhagavat Gita and Brahmasutra, after reading
								these carefully he comes to know of what is Parabrahma, Jeeva-Jagat and Brahma and about what the scriptures are actually trying to tell, so later he comes to a
								conclusion that Bible and Quran are nothing but smritis as compared to several in our Hindu culture and these books are nothing but constitutions of the past and
								the people spreading it are spreading the thoughts which are so limited as compared to our Santhana Dharma.
							</p>
							<p>
								From here on and with the previous practice of yoga and other yogic related practices Sri Prasad quested a long way seeking from several yogis and siddhas and the
								fruit of which was to be borne later.

							<p>
								As a 12yr old boy, during his winter vacations he would always go and sit in the middle of a peepal tree and Jamun Tree which are house in a distant opposite to his
								house for studying, while studying he witnesses an incident where a cowherd signals from a far distance for him not to move and stay still, not knowing what he is
								actually saying the boy nods an ok and continues to read on, then the cowherd slow walks close the boy and tells him to stay rock still and while the confused boy
								moves a bit and looks for some kind of a movement behind him and what he witnesses is a huge King Cobra that sweeps fast to his right side and moves away, on
								witnessing it the boy becomes still in blankness and the cowherd rushes to grab the kid and tells him that you are a blessed child and the snake was standing right
								behind your back as if it was protecting you, the boy goes home and shares this incidence with his parents and they narrate to him of how in the there were stories
								of snakes guarding great spiritual beings. After several years that same place now is a temple for snake deities.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>2nd Incident:</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								As a mid-aged man when he had moved to Bangalore he could see 3 cobras of rare complexion white, yellow and gold would always come and stand at his door entrance
								and right next to his house was a attached an old ruined temple and he was convinced that the snakes could come from that place and after a few days Sri Prasad puts
								up this question to his Guruji and he in turn with his divine ability sees it and asks tells him that they are coming to him seeking for renovation of the temple
								and when the renovation takes place the snakes stop visiting him. A few weeks later when the foundation was laid and a Trident was placed Sri Prasad thinks of
								security for the trident since nobody would live around the place and from then on the snakes were witnessed to have come and guard it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Now the place is a popular temple which houses 9 naga deities which is rare and one of a kind, the temple is famous for Naga worship along with the main deity being
								Sri Vasukinaga Eshwari and even special because for providing remedies to people with Naga Doshas(Serpent Curse as can be found prominent in the birth chart of a
								person which provides ill health, trouble in marriages or no marriage, trouble in getting a child and so on).
							</p>

							<p>
								With the urge to acquire more knowledge of the yogic science, he had learnt from various Siddhas and Yogis which had brought him to a conclusion that something
								greater was awaiting his upliftment; away from stereotypical religious life to selfless spiritual living.
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, the questions that changed the course of his life. Does God really exist? If he exists then why are people suffering? The craving to find answers to his
								questions had finally reached a peak.

							<p>
								On the 27th August 2007 night on full Lunar eclipse, a full moon night under the bright rays of the moon he had seated with closed eyes and as the earth blocked the
								way of light darkening the rays of moon during total lunar eclipse that had encompassed light, the prevailing darkness which had eventually tarnished the eclipse in
								his mind which had blocked him; at Rudra gavi (the cave of Rudra), a cave in Siddharabetta (the mystic's hill), having seated secluded with closed eyes he had
								forgotten himself for 36hours unknown of the time and space, those moments had finally brought him to realization of existential cosmic and self-reality that
								eventually had changed his quest for spiritual seeking that God really exists and each individual is responsible for his/her own sufferings and he had also found
								the remedy for those sufferings through free counseling twice a week using traditional methods and therapeutic benefits along with Eshawri Kriya from which millions
								of people have been benefited
