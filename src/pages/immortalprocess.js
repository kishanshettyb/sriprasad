					<p>
						The theory of <span className="fw-bold">"karma and rebirth"</span> raises numerous questions such as how, when, and why did the cycle start in the first place, what is
						the relative Karmic merit of one karma versus another and why, and what evidence is there that rebirth actually happens, among others.
					</p>
					<p>
						Various schools of Hinduism realized these difficulties, debated their own formulations, some reaching what they considered as internally consistent theories, while
						other schools modified and de-emphasized it, while a few schools in Hinduism such as Chaevakas, Lokayatana abandoned{" "}
						<span className="fw-bold">"karma and rebirth"</span> theory altogether.
					</p>
					<p>
						Schools of Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism and Sikhism consider karma-rebirth cycle as integral to their theories of soteriology ( is the study of religious doctrines of
						salvation ).
					</p>
					<p>The Patanjali Yoga sutra discussed the idea of the inner being becoming burdened with an accumulation of impressions as part of the karma from previous lives.</p>
					<p>
						Patañjali called the process of past-life regression as prati-prasav (literally "reverse birthing"), and saw it as addressing current problems through memories of past
						lives. Some types of yoga continue to use prati-prasav as a practice.
					</p>
					<p>Vedic philosophy, Upanishads and Bhagavad-Gita also supports the theory of Karma and Re-birth</p>

						Moreover, that Brahman in which the five groups of five, the celestial minstrels etc., who are five in number, viz. the celestial minstrels, the Manes, the gods, the
						Asuras and the Rākṣasas—or the four castes with the Caṇḍālas as the fifth and the ether called the Undifferentiated, which pervades the Sūtra, are placed—it has been

					<h2 className="fw-bold display-5 mb-4">The effect of karma and the Rebirth:</h2>
					<p>
						Now as a man is like this or like that, according as he acts and according as he behaves, so will he be; a man of good acts will become good, a man of bad acts, bad; he
						becomes pure by pure deeds, bad by bad deeds; And here they say that a person consists of desires, and as is his desire, so is his will; and as is his will, so is his
						deed; and whatever deed he does, that he will reap.- Brihadaranyaka Upanishad
					</p>
					<p>
						The relationship of karma to causality is a central motif in all schools of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist thought. The theory of karma as causality holds that executed
						actions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives, and the intentions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives.
					</p>
					<p>
						Disinterested actions or unintentional actions do not have the same positive or negative karmic effect, as interested and intentional actions. In Buddhism, for example,
						actions that are performed, or arise, or originate without any bad intent such as covetousness, are considered non-existent in karmic impact or neutral in influence to
						the individual.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another causality characteristic, shared by Karmic theories, is that like deeds lead to like effects. Thus good karma produces good effect on the actor, while bad karma
						produces bad effect. This effect may be material, moral or emotional that is, one's karma affects one's happiness and unhappiness. The effect of karma need not be
						immediate; the effect of karma can be later in one's current life, and in some schools it extends to future lives.
					</p>
					<p>
						The consequence or effects of one's karma can be described in two forms: phalas and samskaras-effect. A phala-results (literally fruit or result) is the visible or
						invisible effect that is typically immediate or within the current life. In contrast, samskaras are invisible effects, produced inside the actor because of the karma,
						transforming the agent and affecting his or her ability to be happy or unhappy in this life and future ones. The theory of karma is often presented in the context of
						samskaras.
					</p>
					<p>
						Karmic principle can be understood as a principle of psychology and habit. Karma seeds habits (Vasana), and habits create the nature of man. Karma also seeds self
						perception, and perception influences how one experiences life events. Both habits and self-perception affect the course of one's life. Breaking bad habits is not easy:
						it requires conscious karmic effort.
					</p>
					<p>
						Thus psyche and habit, according to Potter and others, link karma to causality in ancient Indian literature. The idea of karma may be compared to the notion of a
						person's "character", as both are an assessment of the person and determined by that person's habitual thinking and acting.

					<h2 className="fw-bold display-5 mb-4">Rebirth</h2>
					<p>The third common theme of karma theories is the concept of reincarnation or the cycle of rebirths (saṃsāra).</p>
					<p>
						Rebirth is a fundamental concept of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. The concept has been intensely debated in ancient literature of India; with different
						schools of Indian religions considering the relevance of rebirth as either essential, or secondary, or unnecessary fiction.
					</p>
					<p>
						Rebirth, or saṃsāra, is the concept that all life forms go through a cycle of reincarnation that is a series of births and rebirths. The rebirths and consequent life
						may be in different realm, condition or form. The karma theories suggest that the realm, condition and form depend on the quality and quantity of karma. In schools that
						believe in rebirth, every living being's soul transmigrates (recycles) after death, carrying the seeds of Karmic impulses from life just completed, into another life
						and lifetime of karmas. This cycle continues indefinitely, except for those who consciously break this cycle by reaching Moksha. Those who break the cycle reach the
						realm of gods, those who don't continue in the cycle.

					<h2 className="fw-bold display-6 mt-5">The Bhagavad-gita says:</h2>
					<p>"As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death."(Bg 2.13)</p>
					<p>"As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul similarly accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones."(Bg 2.22)</p>
					<p>So what is your opinion on the above religious beliefs or do you have any questions in your mind about the following ?</p>
					<ul className="regular-ul">
						<li>If I had past lives, why don't I remember them</li>
						<li>Since we don't remember them, what could be the use of them</li>
						<li>If reincarnation is fact, why is the population increasing</li>
						<li>Other major religious books like Bible and Quran denies reincarnation</li>
						<li>Do the past lives really has good and bad effects on our present life</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Immortal process is such a process which makes the individual to experience their past lives and the effect of it on our present life.</p>
					<p>I and YOU are non-perishable, we are not mortal, we are not going to end this life, we have been born on this planet many times, lived many lives in many forms.</p>
					<p>
						Experience your immortality, the eternal reality through “IMMORTAL PROCESS” Each individual enters the Mother's womb with different names and different forms, once born
						the individual forgets the other side of his life's memories.
					</p>
					<p>The memory that might be filled with great skills,</p>
					<ul className="regular-ul">
						<li>Great knowledge,</li>
						<li>Great ability,</li>
						<li>Greater innovations and</li>
						<li>Great talents</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						One can unfold the stored yet, forgotten memories to unfold Past life's skills, knowledge, abilities, ideas and talents by discovering or recovering the other side of
						forgotten memories in the meantime one can clear their
					</p>
					<ul className="regular-ul">
						<li>Bad Karma, Curses, Doshas</li>
						<li>One gets relieved of Negative Psychic attachments</li>
						<li>One can clear Negative Mind Patterns</li>
						<li>One can get relief from Spell, Evil eye, Black magic and many more</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The immortal process or Prati-Prasava (past life regression) process is a tool that provides for recalling events in our past lives that may be the root cause of
						current patterns and behaviors.
					</p>
					<p>
						These patterns can be mental or physical and can be something that needs to be changed or merely understood. The process helps individuals to clear past impressions
						that may be blocking their progress in life and thus begin to live more in the present moment.
					</p>
					<p>The immortal process is a one to one session with Guruji that lasts 30 to 45 minutes and the experience is similar to a deep guided meditation.</p>
