					<p>
						Kalavahana is a divine walk from emotional bindings(bhava paravasha) to the transcendental state beyond emotions(bhavatitha) and the connection in tune with cosmic
						consciousness{" "}
					</p>

					<p>
						Kala means partial subtle part of the core of cosmic consciousness (moola prakriti), avahana means inviting that part to our awareness, which is one of the supreme
						achievements of Sri Vidya Tantra.
					</p>
					<p>
						Basically Kalavahana Puja or Sadhana is a tantric rite, in which the idol of the goddess, the geometrical represenation(chakra), and the rite of tantric rites performed
						by the actual practitioner and the experience of merging(aikyata) with the core of cosmic consciousness (moola prakriti)
					</p>

					<p>
						Worshiping an idol of a goddess or a chakra in a tantric ritual and obtaining the epiphany of the divine is a very ordinary practice, but invoking a live goddess in a
						living person, serving, worshiping and giving oblation to the goddess is a tantric ritual which is considered very special and an excellent method.Here, captivating
						emotions and the emotional realization of the divine are the two main objectives, and for that divino-emotional state the tantric rituals and the practice of tantra are
						fulfilled.
					</p>

					<p>
						Here one practitioner (Sadhaka) takes the place of the Goddess while the other Sadhaka takes the place of the worshiper and both of them undergo some secret and hidden
						Tantra ritualistic procedures during which both of them attain the captive emotional state and the ecstasy of the Goddess, they become the goddess herself and in the
						end they both attain the state beyond emotions and transcend to the higer reality.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this tantra rite - mudra, mantra, yoga chakras and touching the hidden secret points in the body is a method, along with five ritual worship for realizing and
						bringing upon the live Goddess.
					</p>

					<p>
						Through this realization the Sadhaka gets divine experiences, the Yogis and Yoginis comes in contact with the Sadhak who has achieved oneness with the cosmic
						consciousness, through this contact the Sadhaka gets special guidance, protection from difficulties, fulfillment in life and success in worldly and spiritual life.
					</p>
