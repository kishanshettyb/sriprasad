						Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana a Samaya method of yogic tantric practice with the aim to obtain definite achievements in the worldly and spiritual matters, Those who get
						this greatest of“Bhoga and Moksha / Material- riches and Libration”becomes infinite in himself and can get everything from this Universe. They are blessed by “the words
						spoken will Manifest-Vaak Siddhi”, “ The intensified intentions will manifest -Sankalpa Siddhi” and he/she becomes “ The knower of past, present and future - Trikaal
						Darshi”. In fact there is nothing left in this Universe which he/she can't seek.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana samaya arose as part of great Shakta tradition of Yoga Tantra which considers Shakti the Universal energy in feminine form to be the Supreme
						object for Knowledge , Practice and Devotion.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since this sadhana is so sacred, it is said that the King of the Gods - Indra and Maaya will be watching over you. Let go of your ego. All Devas (Gods) respect a Sri
						Vidhya Eshwari Sadhak as much as they respect Lord Bhirava / Bhiravi .
					</p>
					<p>
						Thus a sadhak who meditates daily, if at all encounters a difficulty, he does not fight it alone. The whole universe fights with him as Divine protective energy which
						is always around him.

						It is said in the scriptures thatSri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana is practiced by the Trinities like Lord Bhirava, Lord Narayana, Lord Bramha and his sons, Sanaka rishis,
						Sapta rishis etc. Sri Vidhya Sadhana is the knowledge of the self and Universe, It's the Mantra, Tantra and Yantra Sadhana.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is said that after many births, through the great merits which one carries in this present birth, such a fortune person can only come across a Guru/Master who can
						initiate them toSri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana.
					</p>
					<p>
						To put it in simple terms, basically Sri Vidhya Eshwari sadhana is a deeksha of supreme order given by a self realized guru, in which you are taught how to connect with
						the Cosmic consciousness or Eshwari consciousness. Sadhak will be taught to meditate upon the Nine + Two energy centers , which is generally known as Navavarana Sadhana
					</p>
					<p>
						Lord Shiva or Parameshwara is the first Guru who taught this vidhya in the form ofLord Anandha Bhirava & Lord Dakshinamurthi, Lord Narayana in the form of Lord
						Hayagriva, the above are the three main traditions in Srividhya, from them it passed on to Saptha rishis, Sanaka rishis, Nandikeshwara, Dattatreya , Parashuram, Agastya
						Mahamuni, Ma Lopamudra and so on...
					</p>
					<p>
						Sri Vidhya was also passed down to a worthy disciple through guru-shishya sampradaya / Master and disciple relationship, Later bhagavan Adi Shankaracharya
						re-established Sri Vidhya after culmination of all three forms of the sadhana viz kaadi, haadi and saadi vidhya into one single form.
					</p>
					<p>Sri Vidhya sadhana is known to be taught via 3 methods such as Kaulavachara, Mishra and Samayachara</p>
					<p>
						The Kaulavachara is more over external ritual based way of worship , in Mishra both external and internal method of worship but theSamayachara is totally a internal
						subjective scientific journey towards the absolute( Lalita sahasra nama ; verse 162,{" "}
						<span className="fw-bold special-title text-center fs-3 mb-5">
							<span className="splash-left">Antharmukha</span> samaradhya Bahirmukha <span className="splash-right">sudurlabha</span>
						</span>{" "}
						)
					</p>
					<p>
						Sri Vidhya sadhana has two methods of Practice, Dual/ Dvaita and Non-Dual Advaita. Dvaita sadhana is ritual based practice, hence it follows ritualistic approach
						through Puja, Archana and Havana, etc. Advaita is non-dualistic which is non-ritualistic or Samayachara, The worshipper finds the one being worshipped within self, the
						great sage Guru Adi Shankaracharya has taught both methods of practice to different sections of society or Varna.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana (SVES) is a method of Samaya Achara, the method of Non-dual or Monistic way of practice based on Ancient yogic tantra, most methods of
						practice are being derived from the scripture called Rudrayamala Tantra.
					</p>
					<p>
						The word Samayachara means the conduct as described in the Rudrayamala Tantra, samayachara means the complete process of initiation by Master in which Kundalini
						activation-Raising of the energy from base center to the higher centers making them reach the ultimate destination, step by step (Chith, Prana & Para Kundalini )
					</p>
					<p className="fw-bolder">
						The word Samaya comes from 'samyam yati' meaning that the equality of Masculine-Shiva and Feminine-Shakti energies in union are the essence of the Samayachara, unified
						absolute state of consciousness held in five folds as per Adi Guru Shankaracharya, they are:
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>01. Adhishthana samaya - similarity in abode</b>, <b>02. Anushthana samaya - oneness in indulgence of activities</b>,{" "}
						<b>03. Avastha samaya- similarity and equality in the state as Tandava and Lasya</b>, <b>04. Naama samaya- similarity in the names</b> and <b>05. Roopa samaya</b> -
						similarity in the form and colour, that means they are not separate, different and both are one meaning Shiva is her Transcendent masculine aspect, providing the divine
						ground of all being. There is no Shiva without Shakti, or Shakti without Shiva. The two in themselves are One.
					</p>
					<p>In shortShiva is static Shakti consciousness and Shakti is dynamic Shiva consciousness.</p>
					<p>
						In the 98th name of Eshwari as mentioned in Lalita sahasra namam, "Samayachara tathpara" - The divine Cosmic energy who likes and appreciates the subjective unique
						yogic tantra method of worship, in support to the above mentioned details , the Parashurama kalpa suktham also appreciates the samayachara method of practice.

					<p>
						which means that samayachara is a hidden form of spiritual practice which is revealed on due time to the deserving aspirants. Samayachara involves only Meditation and
						Yogic techniques which is considered as Internal worship or Mental worship (Manasa-upasana), there is no room for external rituals and no provision for external
						objective worship, in samayachara method thebody of the sadhak/ aspirant and the Energy centres are the actually Sri-Yantra.So the Samayacharis do not have any
						Purascharana, Japa, Homa or external pujavidhi.
					</p>
					<p>
						In Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana the method of samayacharais a subjective journey towards the absolute universal consciousnesswhich happens in different stages like
						Beginning- Arambha, Young-Taruna, Adolescence-yauvana and Matured- Prauda. Then starts 'Svairachara' where the sadhaka goes beyond any scriptural restrictions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana (SVES) is the most revered“Kundalini Sadhana”. In this Practice, the sadhak Meditates on his/her own divine energy centers and becomes one
						with the universal consciousness, here the sadhaks learn the technique of installing the Sri Chakra with in their 9 + 2 energy centers and in the Psychic body so that
						the internal practice (Anthar- yaga ) can be done.
					</p>
					<p>
						Kundalini is the Energy which is dormant in the base of spinal cord, placed at Sacral bone, with secret yoga tantra practice one can make it active, the activation of
						dormant energy passes through various kutas / mandalas like,

					<h2 className="display-5 fw-bolder text-start mb-2">Bhaskararaya in his “Setu bandha” refers to five forms of kundalini:</h2>

						The Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana Samayachara is a Shaktha tradition, Shaktha means the one who follows, practices and reveres the Feminine cosmic energy. There are mainly
						three types of feminine cosmic energy activation or Three types of Kundalini activation, which is a very secret, sacred and mystic way of activation, it is only
						possible through Guru-Shishya Parampara (lineage of master and disciple relationship ) as said earlier “TRI-VIDHA KUNDALINI- SHAKTHI STHREE DEVANAN CHA SRUSTAYE” there
						are three types of Kundalini energy the first one is CHITH Kundalini , the second one is PRANA Kundalini and the third and ultimate is PARA Kundalini.
					</p>
					<p>
						Through ESHWARI KRIYA with the blessings of divine will activate your Chith kundalini first, which gives lead to the PRANA Kundalini activation which is been activated
						through ESHWARI SHAKTHI KENDRA SADHANA workshop , after regular practice of these sadhana one can be eligible to take up Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana in two levels.

					<p>
						Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana which is Experiential process based practice as per Anandha Bhirava tradition includes two more types of Kundalini activation methods in
						Levels 01 & 02 of teachings, which unfolds the PARA Kundalini that determines the intense dedicated devotional practice of the sadhak.
					</p>
					<p>
						The right method and authentic yoga tantra methods are very secret, sacred and mystic techniques, these techniques are formed on scientific, experiential, process based
						practices which is very rarely available,Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana is one among such simple yet powerful and effective technique.
					</p>
					<p>
						Simple yet effective is because the sadhak learns and practices to journey the Mind through various conscious levels and states of consciousness through Eshwari Dhyana,
						the sadhak undergoes karmic cleansing acquired from the past lives throughImmortal Process where he/she is made to realize the immortality of his/her existence and
						witness the lifes' of his past, understand the cause of birth, identify and nullify the rough psychic impressions. Through Know Your Purposeworkshop, sadhaks undergo a
						certain effective yogic process which makes them realize a very rare knowledge which is very important to lead a self satisfied and holistic way of living, possible
						when the sadhaks understand his/her purpose of present life. Through Guruji's personal scientific research and observation on Sri Vidhya yoga tantra and the personal
						practice on the same, the benefits and results out of the practice proved to turn out marvelous, here are some of them as mentioned so that one can agree that indeed
						Sri Vidhya Samayachara method is very scientific. Yet, to gain official response a research has to be conducted and needs to be submitted for clinical experiments,
						verifications and inference but one thing is confirmed that Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana is the Scientific practice and not at all hypothetic or just a belief .
					</p>
					<p>Some examples are mentioned here for which references are made and interpreted on Lalitha sahasranamam - Verse 22,</p>
					<p>
						Sriman nagara nayika - She who is the chief of Sri NagaraChinthamani grihanthastha - , in human physiology the Chinatamani gruha means the Mid Brain. She who lives in
						it and which is the every wish full filling house, here Chintamani refers to Pineal gland, which is a spiritual gland, apart from Hinduism many religions Christianity,
						Buddhism , Jainism , Greek culture, Egypt traditions and Sufism have accepted and spoken of the importance but, only Islamic belief system does not accept.
					</p>
					<p>
						Pancha brahmasana sthitha - "She who sits on the five brahmas like Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Maheshwara & Sadashiva these are the abilities of the Consciousness like
						Creation , Maintenance , Destruction and Re- constriction, Blessing and Punishing along with the great ability to witness every act and stay hidden are the 5 abilities.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Pineal gland symbolically and physiologically represents the Chinthamani, Nine Enclosures of Chintamani gruha symbolically and physiologically represents the nine
						layers of the brain like Scalp, Skull , 3 layers of meninges, gray matter ,white matter and so on, there are many more of such symbolical and physiological similarities
						and similiar functions that one can see and notice.
