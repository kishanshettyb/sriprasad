					<p>
						Devi Mathangi is a tantric goddess. She is one of the Mahavidyas ten Tantric goddesses, she is considered to be the Tantric Saraswati, the goddess of music, art,
						Hypnosis, Tantra, Mantra Practice and learning (Vidya) and the Devi for Vashiya (Controlled possession or Subjugation) .{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						Matangi governs speech, music, knowledge and the arts. Her worship is prescribed to acquire supernatural powers, especially gaining control over enemies, attracting
						people to oneself, acquiring mastery over the arts and gaining supreme knowledge
					</p>
					<p>
						In yoga tantra practice, the sadhana is one of activation of fourteen principal yoga Nadis, the name of the Nadi is Saraswati or Suvani Nadi which is situated at the
						tip of the tongue{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						Saraswati Nadi is thought to give energy to the tongue, mouth, and throat, and controls speech. It’s also believed to have a role in the awakening and rise of Kundalini
						through Sushumna Nadi. Additionally, it’s said to keep the abdominal organs free from disease
					</p>
					<p>
						Another interesting fact is that Saraswati Nadi has exactly the same trajectory as the main pathway of the Thai Sen Line Sumana, which confirms the notion that
						Saraswati Nadi is intimately connected to Sushumna Nadi as branch or extension{" "}
					</p>

					<p>
						When the Sadhak practices Devi Mathangi sadhana with the support of Manthra, Yantra, Mudra with certain Herbs he/she can activate the Saraswathi Nadi and gain desirable
						siddhis
					</p>

					<p>It is considered that, the auspicious time for the practice is on the Magha masa ( Feb/March) Gupta Navarathri. </p>
