					<p>Bharath is a such country here most of festivals are incorporated with Scientific knowledge, human values and Rituals based celebration .</p>
					<p>This country always focused on two aspects of living, the first one is celebrations and the next one is liberation, both are possible only with the realization .</p>
					<p>This country is a land of seekers , so this country is always focused on the realization - Self or absolute .</p>
					<p>
						<b>Life is a celebration, The Celebration towards ultimate librations through Self-realization, it is a possible way of Holistic living - Sri Prasad</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						The festivals Navarathri and Shivarathri both are a way of Yogic practice which can make your life to celebrate as well as to Liberate through Self-realization , a way
						of yogic practice involves with Silence , Fasting, Chanting and a secrete sacrate practice, which makes one to experience Bhoga and Yoga.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most of us are aware that we have two Navarathri, but one must know that there are two more known as Gupta means Mystic , so totally we have four Navarathri in a year,
						Known as Chithra ,Maga , Ashada and Sharan or Maha Navarathri, The maga masa and ashada masa Navarathri is known as Guptha Navarathri but the main one is which falls in
						the month of September and October that is Sharan Navarathri{" "}
					</p>
					<p>When Navratri is celebrated, The body mind and spirit rest and renews itself through the nine nights of Navratri.</p>
					<p>
						Just as a child grows in the mother's womb for nine months, Night provides rest and rejuvenation. During the night, you turn inwards through sleep, and you wake up
						feeling refreshed and rested in the morning. In the same way, Navratri or the 'nine nights' is that time of the year when you get the chance to experience deep rest.
						This deep rest brings freedom from all kinds of botherations, deep relaxation, and creativity.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our spirit has existed since time immemorial. It is the boundless and the eternal source of energy of this universe. During Navratri, even the subtle energies in the
						environment enhance and assist oneâ€™s experience of reaching the Spirit{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						The Silence , Fasting, chanting, and Meditation during Navratri connects us with our spirit, Getting in touch with the spirit invokes positive qualities within us and
						destroys laziness, pride, obsession, cravings, and aversions, which are mentioned in our purana like Demons, Namely Mahishasura , Bhandasura, Madhukaitaba, Shumbha &
						Nishumbha so on
					</p>
					<p>When stress in the form of negative emotions is destroyed, we experience the deep rest of the transforming in nine nights.</p>
					<p>
						Eshwari or the Divine Mother is the energy which has given birth to the entire universe including the celestial stars far away and the subtle mind and its emotions.
						Called 'shakti' which means energy, the Divine Mother is also responsible for nurturing her creation.
					</p>
					<p>Navratri is the time when this energy can be tapped. One of the ways to do so is Silence , Fasting, chanting, and Meditation during Navratri </p>
					<p>
						It is said that <b>"SHAKTHI TRIGUNAVALAMBINI"</b> The Divine Mother or Shakti has three major Guna( Tamas, Rajas and Sattva) and three main personified forms like Kali
						the Goddess of defense, Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth, Saraswati- the Goddess of Knowledge .{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						During the nine nights and ten days of Navratri, these three forms are invoked to rise Sattva guna , we need all three gunas, in the absence of Tamas one cannot even
						sleep , in the absence of Rajas one cannot even function physically and mentally , so all gunas are need to live a holistic life , The Eshwari is beyond all these three
						gunas, the process of Navarathri is establish oneself in that state of consciousness which is beyond three gunas , so Devi is revered as Trigunavalambini as well as
						Trigunateetha or Thurishwari .
					</p>
					<p>
						In spiritual plane Navratri is celebration of the principle or tattva of Shakti. is worshipped in 3 different forms - Ichchashakti, Kriya shakti and Jnanashakti as per
						the agamas. As per the kalpas (or Puranas), shakti is worshipped as Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Maha Saraswati. On all the nine days, Devi Mahatyam and Srimad Devi
						Bhagavatam are recited.
					</p>
					<p>This is a unique festival where in on one hand, celebration happens and on the other, one can delve deeper to gain knowledge of the self or realization </p>
					<p>Moreover, there are six distortions, or vices of the mind which are been mentioned as Demons in Devi purana </p>
					<ul className="regular-ul">
						<li>Kama (desire),</li>
						<li>Krodha (anger),</li>
						<li>Lobha (greed),</li>
						<li>Moha (infatuation)</li>
						<li>Mada (arrogance), and</li>
						<li>Matsarya (jealousy).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						These distortions can go out of control in any human being, and become an obstacle on the spiritual path. They can be dissolved during these nine days of Navratri, with
						the grace of Shakti.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sadhana or Tapasya or upasana are performed during these nine days, along with <b>Silence , Fasting , Chanting and Meditation.</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						With Guruji's guidance all Nine days at Eshwari Peeta / Sri Vasukinaga Eshwari Temple, our I and You being together foundation volunteers and Eshwari Sadhana sadhaks
						performs Seva, Sankalpa and Sadhana throughout Nine nights and Ten days , at our Temple{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Sankalpa -</b> for any puja or Homa, a commitment is required. In order to obtain success in achieving our goal, we pray to the divine at the beginning of the pujas
						and this is called sankalpa. When a yagna of such a great magnitude is being conducted in the Temple, by taking a sankalpa, benevolence is showered on us and the whole
						world, the mind gets purified and we obtain clarity.
					</p>
					<p>
						When sankalpa is taken by an individual for his/her family, it is called Atmartha sankalpa. At the same time, when sankalpa is taken for the benefit of the whole world,
						it is called Parartha sankalpa.
					</p>
					<p>
						We conduct <b>6 types of Homa during Navarathri for both Atmartha & Parartha Sankalpa</b> for family and world as one family, the six Homas are{" "}

					<h2 className="display-5 fw-bold mb-4">The significance of Homas </h2>
					<p>
						<b>Sri Ganapathi homa -</b> For any work to be accomplished, positive and negative energies come into play. These energies need not always be external; they can be in
						our body and mind also. Hence, we pray to Lord Ganesha, the remover of all obstacles. It is a tradition to perform Ganesha homa and puja before we begin any yagna.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Navagraha homa -</b> Navagrahas, or the nine planets, are important, and their movements or Grahagathi influence the whole earth and every individual living on it.
						So, the nine planets are honored by offering nine different varieties of ahutis. This is accompanied by chanting of the mantras, which are specific to each planet.
						Specific planets influence specific parts of our body and they also influence specific grains and gems.
					</p>
					<p>
						Planets have an influence on every happening on earth. We pray to the nine planets to decrease or ward off their negative influence on us, and to further enhance the
						positive influence they are, already, exerting on us.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Saptha Rishi homa -</b> This homa is done on the last day of Navratri. Rishis are the Drishtaaraha - those who have entered deep samadhi and downloaded the mantras
						from the Vedas from space. We perform the Rishi homa to express our gratitude to the rishis who have given this sacred knowledge for the upliftment of mankind. Prayers
						are done for the Saptharishis and other important rishis, and this begins with the Guru Puja.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Subrahmanya & Nava Naga homa -</b> Lord Subrahmanya is the god of victory. To succeed in any endeavor, Jnana Shakti, or the energy of knowledge, is needed. So,
						Bramhanya mantras are chanted and Lord Subrahmanya is invoked along with Nine Serpents to remove hurdles , obstacles in ones levies{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Sri Rudra homa -</b> The Rudra homa gives us peace, and removes all the sadness from our lives. Rudra mantras, including Namaka and Chamaka mantras, are chanted
						during this homa. Honoring Rudra mantras helps us go deep in meditation and brings a balance of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Rudra mantras dissolve the three gunas and help
						us enter the state of nothingness in deep meditation. At The Art of Living International Center, 11 priests perform the Rudra homa by chanting the Rudra mantras eleven
						times; and this is known as Ekadasha Rudra homa.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Chandika Homa -</b> Chandi Homam is a sacred Fire Lab performed to invoke the blessings of Goddess Chandi - the fierce and powerful form of Goddess Shakti. She is
						the primeval energy and is responsible for the creation, sustenance, and destruction of this entire universe. She is hailed as the sum total of the energies of all
						lives in this universe. According to the sacred text, Devi Mahatmyam, she is portrayed with eighteen arms, each holding a different weapon to ward off all the
						negativities and guard her beloved devotees.
					</p>
					<p>
						Goddess Chandi is an embodiment of power and all the divine forces, who safeguards you from evil forces and perfects your mind and body. By worshipping the Universal
						Mother through this sacred Fire Lab, you can get rid of negative forces such as evil eye, curses, and obstacles and be bestowed with lasting health, wealth and
						prosperity
