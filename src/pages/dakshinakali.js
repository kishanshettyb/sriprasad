					<p>
						The name Kali means Dark energy which is beyond time and force of time. When there were neither the creation, nor the sun, the moon, the planets, and the earth, there
						was only darkness and everything was created from the darkness. The Dark appearance of Kali represents the darkness from which everything was born.[4] Her complexion is
						black. As she is also the goddess of Preservation, Kali is worshipped as the preserver of nature Kali is standing calm on Shiva, her appearance represents the
						preservation of mother nature. Her free, long and black hair represents nature's freedom from civilization Under the third eye of kali, the signs of both sun, moon, and
						fire are visible which represent the driving forces of nature. Kali is not always thought of as a Dark Goddess. Despite Kali's origins in battle, she evolved to a
						full-fledged symbol of Mother Nature in her creative, nurturing and devouring aspects.{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						There are several interpretations of the symbolism behind the commonly represented image of Kali standing on Shiva's supine form. A common interpretation is that Shiva
						symbolizes purusha, the universal unchanging aspect of reality, or pure consciousness. Kali represents Prakruti, nature or matter, sometimes seen as having a feminine
						quality of creation of life. The merging of these two qualities represents ultimate reality.{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						A tantric interpretation sees Shiva as consciousness and Kali as power or energy. Consciousness and energy are dependent upon each other, since Shiva depends on Shakti,
						or energy, in order to fulfil his role in creation, preservation, and destruction. In this view, without Shakti, Shiva is a corpseâ€”unable to act.{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						Kali could be considered a general concept, like Durga, and is primarily worshipped in the Kali Kula sect of worship. The closest way of direct worship is Maha Kali or
						Bhadrakali (Bhadra in Sanskrit means 'gentle'), Dakshina kali, Kali is worshipped as one of the 10 Maha vidya forms of Adi Parashakti,{" "}
					</p>
					<p>Dakshina kali has very powerful and bearable Healing energy, through that energy one can heal himself and others too</p>
					<p>
						The advantage of Dakshina Kali Healing energy is borrowed from the Kundalini energy along with the cosmic energy, through that one can heal the stress, psychosomatic
						issue, Black energies, Evil eye, Spell and even the Black magic
					</p>
					<p>
						Commonly people who involved in the Healing (Rekhi, Pranic Healing and more), they generally experience the energy Bounce back problem, because of the they can see the
						problems in their health, finance and relationships{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						Here the Sadhak connects him self with the lineage of Shakta Tantra (Kali kula) so the bounce back issue the Sadhak will need not to face, it will be taken care by the
						lineage deities
					</p>
					<p>
						The Dakshina Kali sadhana process is inclusive of Nirmali Karana (Healing) which is involved with the Mantra, Mudra, Yantra and the Amavasya night yoga tantra procedure
						and the herbs to cleanse the affected person{" "}
