					<p className="fw-bold">This information is from guruji when one of our sadhaks raised the question before the workshop , the question was</p>

					<p>
						<b>Sadhak:</b> Guruji what is Eshwari Kriya ? Is it a Breathing technique, Yoga or Meditation, Hypnosis or Healing?
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>Guruji:</b> So many questions at once, i will answer your questions by raising a question
					</p>

					<p className="fw-bold">What was the 1st immediate act that you performed after your birth?</p>

							<p>
								Most people say that their act was Crying and i hope most of us will agree with that but if you ask me, I would say it's a big No, do you know why ? because the 1st
								immediate act which we perform was Breathing , we inhale the air to our system, the air which we inhale is not only the oxygen , in our yogic science we call it as
								Prana, Prana means Life or Life force energy in the mother's womb you were alive but there was no breathing , here you have to pay enough attention to understand
								this yogic science, there was no breathing in the mother's womb but you and i were alive with the grace and love of our biological mother and the cosmic mother,
								once you came out from the womb to experience and to fulfill your purpose of life, the breathing will connect you with the cosmos.
							</p>
							<p>
								The breath is the bridge between you and the body, meanwhile its also the bridge between you and the nature ,with the proper use of Breath, yogic science and the
								profound unique yogic techniques , one can manage and handle or bring balance in their physical , mental and emotional level of their existence and when the
								thoughts, emotions and actions, the basic fundamental instincts of your being has been taken care then one can lead a happy, healthy, prosperous and successful
								life.

							<p>
								Now the question is how can one take care of thoughts ,emotions and actions which is beyond our control, actions can be taken into control but how about thoughts
								and emotions? The thoughts and emotions leads to an action , the intension and the intensity of the intention is what makes thoughts materialize, so from here
								onwards the spiritual journey will start, when i say spiritual people often think and analyze on the dimension of religion, the religion is not at all spirituality,
								religion is a belief , a system of belief, belief on some other realized person's experience but the experiences are not your experience, so spiritual science is
								that science which makes a person to rise from the level of belief to the height of self experience;so here i am not denying or defaming the religious belief, in
								the mean time i am not even recommending to blindly following it, my intention is very much lucid, the intention or the motive behind it is just to make you lead a
								happy, healthy, prosperous and successful life ,the intention is just to make you experience your existential and the supreme reality of the cosmos, without going
								against to your religious beliefs', i will make you lead a meaningful , useful and well lived with the support of yogic science which is Non- Religious.
							</p>
							<p>
								If anyone thinks that in the present lifestyle, social conditions and global challenges leading a happy ,healthy, prosperous and successful life is not impossible i
								would say No; it is very much possible , to make that possible the best and the simple thing one must do and commit to do is an individual need to invest or
								allocate or dedicate 20min everyday of one's precious life.

							If you agree to do this then you are eligible to attend my workshop, ESHWARI KRIYA. ESHWARI means the absolute transcendental cosmic consciousness and KRIYA means a
							conscious journey towards it, the journey will provide you healthy body , stress free mind, well balanced emotions and harmony in relationships and society which
							makes your life very much successful, we have only one life and one chance to lead it so better lead it peacefully. Eshwari Kriya is designed on the base of profound
							yogic scientific knowledge the knowledge taken from the good old scripture called Vigyan Bhirava Tantra a chapter from Rudra Yamala Tantra here, Vigyan means science,
							Bhirava means Transcendental consciousness and the tantra literally means the technology or a technique. The benefits of Eshwari Kriya, a 20 minute profound unique
							yogic technique mainly works on 3 levels of our existence those are physical body , astral body and causal body in other words in and out of our Body ,Thoughts and
							Emotions.The root cause of many of our problems have been seen rising from these 3 main levels of our existence. Eshwari Kriya will brings balance between body,
							thoughts and emotions one can experience such balance within a span of 30 to 40 days.

					<h2 className="fw-bold display-5 text-center mb-5">Celebrate life through Eshwari kriya</h2>
					<p>
						I often tell my Sadhaks to Celebrate life, life is a celebration, it's a celebration by default but, why then are we struggling to lead a happy life ? why are we
						suffering ? why does it feel as if life is a misery ? It’s because we do not know the management, you may be a management student or an expert in objective world but
						life is a subjective world, so to celebrate life one must know the management of Body, Mind and Emotions for that one should have five types of strength which are
						already present but needs to be strengthened consciously without strengthening it one cannot experience the absolute truth, in sanskrit we call it as Bala (Strength)
						there are basically five types of Bala or Strenght or Power, the first one is Deha Bala which means Physical Strength , the second one is Mano Bala meaning Psychic
						Strength , the third one is Budhi Bala means Intellectual strength or Power , the fourth one is Athma Bala meaning the Power of the inner being and fifth one is very
						important that is Dhiva Bala means the power of the divine.
					</p>

					<p>
						You might be powerful or strong enough physically, mentally and intellectually but weak in terms of power of the inner being, then you cannot experience success in the
						meantime if you are strong at all above said four types of strengths but missing the cosmic support or divine’s grace and blessings even then one cannot experience
						success, here i am mentioning success in that context meaning happy, healthy,wealthy and holistic life.
					</p>

					<p>
						To lead a holistic life one must strengthen the above five strengths. Eshwari Kriya is such an unique yogic technique which brings inner alignment in your body, mind,
						and energy which results in gaining the five strengths and leads to holistic living.
					</p>

					<p>
						Eshwari Kriya is a SHAKTHA method of KUNDALINI activation, Shaktha means the one who follows, practices and reveres the Feminine cosmic energy . There are three types
						of feminine cosmic energy activation, which is very secret and sacred the activation is only possible through Guru-Shishya Parampara (lineage of master and disciple
						relationship ) in the scriptures it is said that
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>"TRIVIDHA KUNDALINI SHAKTHI STHREE DEVANAN CHA SRUSTAYE"</b> there are three types of Kundalini energy the first one is CHITH Kundalini , the second one is PRANA
						kundalini and the third and ultimate is PARA kundalini so I will explain about the details of Kundalini later, through Eshwari Kriya with the blessings of divine will
						activate your Chith kundalini first, which gives lead to the other two kundalini activation.
					</p>

					<p>
						Intentionally i do not want to talk more about the Kundalini activation because it has the most corrupted, manipulated and wrongly understood, the western world has
						manipulated and dissolved the entire method and the purpose of kundalini activation to their limited understanding such as, they ask the sadhaks to imagine the colors,
						visualize the petals or they use some hypnosis methods etc etc .., i personally and so does our schools of yoga tantra disagree with such incorrect methods of
						activation, the right method and authentic yoga tantra methods are very secret and sacred techniques, Eshwari Kriya is one among such simple yet powerful and effective
						technique.
					</p>

					<p>To celebrate life and to lead a holistic lifestyle, Eshwari Kriya is a boon to the mankind.</p>

						<b>ESHWARI KRIYA</b> is a time-tested practice that cultivates boundless levels of Emotional, Psychological and Physical fitness. It’s a busy and Competitive world we
						live in today with increasing demands on employers and employees alike. We work long hours, often hunched over a computer. We skip meals, keep a phone glued to our ear,
						and rarely leave our workspace for a break. Before long, these work habits begin to take their toll on our bodies and minds in the form of stress, tension and sickness
						and while a mild amount of stress can help us meet deadlines, too much stress, or constant stress, can interfere with numerous physical and mental abilities. How we
						respond to stress can have a significant impact on our total health. ESHWARI KRIYA can remove stress from the body and mind.
