					<p>
						For want of child the couple with their family set out to a pilgrimage to Dharmasthala, Mangalore located in the midst of a thick rain forest, a popular place where
						scores of devotees flock to get a glimpse of lord Shiva, before entering the temple the couple take a dip in the holy Netravathi river, after taking a dip the couple
						come across cashew nut trees and of them one such tree houses a big cashew apple hung on to a topmost branch and the woman urges to eat, the husband tries all he could
						and so does his old father, after a while an old Natha Sadhu passes on the same route while witnessing the event he walks close the lady and says you are going to
						blessed with a fruit(prasada) and soon after he walks past the trees and disappears the cashew fruit comes crashing down, the lady reveres it as a blessing and eats the
						fruit and they all finish their visit to the temple and return to their house after which a boy will be born of the couple and so the boys dad names him Prasada.

					<h2 className="fw-bold display-6 mb-5">His childhood</h2>
					<p>
						His first lesson in spirituality came from his father at the age of 5, who was a practitioner of BKS Iyengar Yoga who had then introduced him to Hatha yoga, having
						quested a long way he was actively involved in civil community services throughout his adolescence such as Scouts, NCC and has staged various Street plays to protest
						and bring awareness to the general public.
					</p>
					<p>
						Having born to a Hindu family he would perform religious practices with his mother, being brought up in an Islamic neighborhood he had learnt and practiced Islamic
						teachings, gaining insight into the knowledge of Quran, his involvement in Christianity came from his schooling in a Christian institution where he would attend Church
						gatherings to gain knowledge from Bible. His mother was an orthodoxly religious person while his father a practical man who mostly believed in social service than
						performing rituals. Being born a Hindu and having experienced diverse religions he had learnt to selflessly serve humanity from his father and found the inner meaning
						and purpose behind the religious rituals from his mother.{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						On one such occasion during his summer holidays after he had completed his 10th grade examination he gets a call from his NCC and Painting master who instructs him to
						head to Kaveri Ashram while he was living in Veerajpet, Coorg that he go a paint a logo of Sri Ramakrishna Mutt in the ashram's podium and after he finishes the ashram
						chief greets him and asks him to come back to the same place on a particular date and they have planned to honor him with a gift, he arrives back at the ashram on the
						said date to witness scores of people in the ashram and soon after a program takes start and the young boy Sri Prasad will be called on to the stage and will be
						presented a Bhagavat Gita book, after the program the chief of ashram a Swamiji of highest rank speaks of a discourse from chapter 4 of Bhagavat Gita, there he speaks
						of what a god is like, he says at every interval in time he will be born again and again, even Lord Krishna is one such avatar and as per Bhagavat Gita Krishna himself
						says that he will born back as Kalki which is another avatar of the Lord Vishnu, he further quotes how Krishna tells Arjuna that he has propounded the Gita to Brahma,
						Surya, Manu, Ikshvaku and so on, then Arjuna ask Krishna how could you do so when they were in existence several 100s and 1000s of years ago, for which Lord Krishna
						replies that though I am born now, I remember all of my previous births and that is not possible with you Arjuna. The chief of the ashram interprets this as, this
						universal consciousness is born as Rama, Krishna, Jesus, Moses, Ibrahim, Guru Nanak and even Mahatma Gandhi, now after listening to this Sri Prasad had gained real gift
						of his life, it was a grand opening to his quest for truth, which otherwise he was convinced that Jesus is true messenger of god who is the son of the Lord as per his
						Christian learnings, another message had put him in great dilemma which is from Islamic teachings that there is no other that befits a god other than allah and more so
						when he came home to see several pictures of deities in the puja house. He started learning from the Gita and in BG he comes across Prasthana Triya which says how a
						spiritual aspirant must know 3 scriptures, they are 10 Upanishads, Bhagavat Gita and Brahma sutra, after reading these carefully he comes to know of what is Parabrahma,
						Jeeva-Jagat and Brahma and about what the scriptures are actually trying to tell, so later he comes to a conclusion that Bible and Quran are nothing but smritis as
						compared to several in our Hindu culture and these books are nothing but constitutions of the past and the people spreading it are spreading the thoughts which are so
						limited as compared to our Santhana Dharma.{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						From here on and with the previous practice of yoga and other yogic related practices Sri Prasad quested a long way seeking from several yogis and siddhas and the fruit
						of which was to be borne later.

					<p className="fw-bold fs-5">His Family</p>
					<p>Sri Prasad married Pallavi. RM in the year 1999, a home maker and are blessed with two daughters.</p>

					<p className="fw-bold fs-5">Spiritual life </p>
					<p>
						As a 12yr old boy, during his winter vacations he would always go and sit in the middle of a Peepal tree and Jamun Tree which are house in a distant opposite to his
						house for studying, while studying he witnesses an incident where a cowherd signals from a far distance for him not to move and stay still, not knowing what he is
						actually saying the boy nods an ok and continues to read on, then the cowherd slow walks close the boy and tells him to stay rock still and while the confused boy moves
						a bit and looks for some kind of a movement behind him and what he witnesses is a huge King Cobra that sweeps fast to his right side and moves away, on witnessing it
						the boy becomes still in blankness and the cowherd rushes to grab the kid and tells him that you are a blessed child and the snake was standing right behind your back
						as if it was protecting you, the boy goes home and shares this incidence with his parents and they narrate to him of how in the there were stories of snakes guarding
						great spiritual beings. After several years that same place now is a temple for snake deities.
					</p>
					<p className="fw-bold">2nd Incident:</p>
					<p>
						As a mid-aged man when he had moved to Bangalore he could see 3 cobras of rare complexion white, yellow and gold would always come and stand at his door entrance and
						right next to his house was a attached an old ruined temple and he was convinced that the snakes could come from that place and after a few days Sri Prasad puts up this
						question to his Guruji and he in turn with his divine ability sees it and asks tells him that they are coming to him seeking for renovation of the temple and when the
						renovation takes place the snakes stop visiting him. A few weeks later when the foundation was laid and a Trident was placed Sri Prasad thinks of security for the
						trident since nobody would live around the place and from then on the snakes were witnessed to have come and guard it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now the place is a popular temple which houses 9 naga deities which is rare and one of a kind, the temple is famous for Naga worship along with the main deity being Sri
						Vasukinaga Eshwari and even special because for providing remedies to people with Naga Doshas (Serpent Curse as can be found prominent in the birth chart of a person
						which provides ill health, trouble in marriages or no marriage, trouble in getting a child and so on).
					</p>
					<p>
						With the urge to acquire more knowledge of the yogic science, he had learnt from various Siddhas and Yogis which had brought him to a conclusion that something greater
						was awaiting his upliftment; away from stereotypical religious life to selfless spiritual living.{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, the questions that changed the course of his life. Does God really exist? If he exists then why are people suffering? The craving to find answers to his
						questions had finally reached a peak.
					</p>
					<p className="fw-bold fs-5">Realization at Siddharabetta </p>
					<p>
						On the 27th August 2007 night on full Lunar eclipse, a full moon night under the bright rays of the moon he had seated with closed eyes and as the earth blocked the way
						of light darkening the rays of moon during total lunar eclipse that had encompassed light, the prevailing darkness which had eventually tarnished the eclipse in his
						mind which had blocked him; at Rudra gavi (the cave of Rudra), a cave in Siddharabetta (the mystic's hill), having seated secluded with closed eyes he had forgotten
						himself for 36hours unknown of the time and space, those moments had finally brought him to realization of existential cosmic and self-reality that eventually had
						changed his quest for spiritual seeking that God really exists and each individual is responsible for his/her own sufferings and he had also found the remedy for those
						sufferings through free counseling twice a week using traditional methods and therapeutic benefits along with Eshawri Kriya from which millions of people have been
						benefited

					<h2 className="fw-bold display-5 mb-4">About the Temple </h2>
					<p>
						Temples are not just a place for prayers, people of this country must understand this truth, the wisdom behind construction of temples are based on the wellbeing of the
						individual, society, nation, nature and the cosmos{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						Vision behind construction of temples is a vast and unconceivable science, when you look at the records from history of this country the temples have always been
						centres for Teachings, Knowledge, Culture, Judiciary, Social upliftment and many more
					</p>
					<p>
						Among those are some temples which have been designed to provide treatment for Physical, Mental and Malefic effects based on energy levels, even now we have such
						temples in our country but they are not functioning as per the scientific ways to treat the malefic effects, most temples function based on the Faith based rituals,
						this is due to the invaders' attacks that we lost and gave into destruction of lots of scriptures which held scientific knowledge to treat the malefic effects during
						the medieval period
					</p>
					<p>
						Now the doubt that arises, is there any place or temple where one can get remedy for such malefic effects? is there anyone who has the scientific knowledge on treating
						such effects? the answer is Yes, there is a temple in Bangalore, where one can get relief from such malefic effects.{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						Sri Vasukinaga Eshwari temple is one among such temples which provides remedies and treatments based on scientific methods for those who have Dosha/malefic effects of
						Rahu & Ketu or Sarpa/Naga Dosha, Mangalik or Kuja dosha and the temple is a centre for Sri Vidhya spiritual teachings in the name of Eshwari Sadhana{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						We at Sri Vasukinaga Eshwari temple for the past 22 years of serving the needy effectively and the Deity worshipped at the Temple being Sri chakra Tripura Sundari aka
						The Ultimate Goddess who rests on the Tortoise (Kurma Peeta) along with Vasuki Naga (King of the serpents ) and at the Temple Nine other Naga devatas(Serpent Deities)
						are installed they are Anantha, Vasuki, Takshaka, Padhma, Maha padhma, Shankapaala, Kalinga, Karkotaka and Shesha, this place of worship is a first of its kind in our
						country having two more additional serpents at the entrance they are Gulika and Mandhi.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sri Tripureshwari seated on Kurma/Tortoise along with King of the Serpents Vasuki and surrounded with Nine + Two total eleven Naga Devatas, 1st of its kind in our
						country{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						Here at temple, every full moon evening we perform Nava Avarana Sri Chakra Puja and on new moon evening Durga Homa will be performed along with regular Rahukala pujas
						on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday, performed for overall wellbeing.
					</p>

					<h2 className="fw-bold display-5">What is a Dosha - Malefic effects?</h2>
					<p>
						One should understand that the subject I explain is not superstitious and not even mystic, I must say it is science, if it has not come to your experience then you may
						term it the way you want but that not does not fulfil the truth.
					</p>
					<p>
						As the quantum physics and several researches says that emotions and energies will travel or exchange from person to person. the university has done research on the
						same but, the Yogic science from ages has expounded that Energy can travel from person to person, they had experienced and explored further deep into that, energy will
						travel through human eyes and emotions will travel through breath and so too are the animals not far away from this truth.
					</p>
					<h2 className="fw-bold display-6 mt-5 mb-4">There are mainly 3 ways, why, malefic effects or exchange of energies happen in our life</h2>
					<Row>
						<Col md={4}>
							<ul className="award-ul">
								<li>01. Exchange of emotions and energies </li>
								<li>02. Direct & Indirect Malefic effects </li>
								<li>03. Carried from previous births </li>
							</ul>
						</Col>
					</Row>
					<p>
						<b>Exchanges of emotions and energies.</b> Yes, the yogic science says that energy will travel through our eyes which definitely has the connections with our heart
						which is the emotional centre, heart is not just a blood pumping machine but, the heart centre also carries different types of emotions like hate, fear, insecurity,
						doubt, positivity, trust, belief, courage and love which we can sense through our heart centre in the same way at our stomach and navel regions one can sense or
						experience joy, so when we laugh too much we get ache at stomach, hope you might have experienced it? Even more so at the same area one can sense generosity, compassion
						but the negative emotions which has over taken is more active in this area as envy & jealousy so in many Indian languages’ emotions have been termed that relates to the
						stomach like in Kannada- Hotte kichu, Tamil - Vayiru pattiyeridu, Telugu - Kadupu Manta and in Hindi Pét jalan
					</p>
					<p>
						The jealousy and hatred kinds of emotions travel through our breath to some other person, if the intensity is sharp it connects with the energy which we emit through
						our eyes and it really causes hurt to the other person and meanwhile we receive the same from others too.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Direct & Indirect Malefic effects</b> when someone has got the direct Malefic effect like Black magic or Evil eye is known as direct effect and the one who come to
						such effected persons contact and receives the same effect is known as Indirect effects, the both effects are same intense to affect the individual progress in terms of
						Health, Wealth, Relationship and succuss Normally such exchanges of emotions and energies happens during gatherings like meetings, Marriage celebrations, Birthday
						functions or any kind of celebrations that involve people and deeper impacts are found when we attending the death ceremonies.{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						Emotions are emotions there is nothing as good or bad emotions but, we for our comforts and convenience have differentiated them as good emotions and bad emotions, the
						emotions that give pleasure and joy we tend to feel that it was a good one, if it gives pain and sadness then we will consider it as bad.
					</p>
					<p>
						Carried from previous births Emotions are of two kinds, one is generated by the self and the other one is generated by others, when generated both positive and negative
						energies or emotions will get exchanged and it is stored in the psychic body that is termed as in Para-psychology as psychic attachments in Tantra yoga it is termed as
						Dosha(Malefic), Shapa (Curse ), Drusthi (evil eye) Krithrima dosha(Black magic) & Vyadhi (Disease) such attachments will continue from one birth to another and from our
						past lives to the present life.
					</p>
					<p>
						Even ayurveda speaks about the past livies psychic attachments will couse a diseas, which is mentioned in astanga ridhaya like{" "}
						<b>“purva-janma-krtam papam vyadhi-rüpena jayate”</b> which may be glossed, "the fault-Sin committed in a previous birth takes the shape of disease in this present
						life"- Astanga Ridhaya{" "}
					</p>
					<p className="fw-bold fs-5 mt-5">So, is it true that animals also can curse?</p>
					<p>
						Why not? before that one needs to understand the meaning of curse, curse means a psychic attachment which carries the emotional pain that the animal has gone through,
						in this context any animal can curse, but among all animals some are very sensitive in nature and their curse is very intensive in nature, if such animal has gone under
						emotional pain being caused by humans that deed is enough to attach it with our mind, they don’t need to do that intentionally. So, such pain or suffering caused by a
						person will get such malefic effect, if not treated properly it will carried to your next birth.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am listing some animals which have such intense power to curse which gets attaches to our psychic body, they are Cow (Gow), Cat (Marjala), Dog(swana), Parrot(shuka),
						Crow (Kaaka), Maina (sharika) and Snake (sarpa){" "}
					</p>
					<p className="fw-bold fs-5 mt-5">How to identify?</p>
					<p>
						There are many methods followed still in our country, Astrology is the main means, a look at the birth chart by a good, well versed, well experienced astrologer the
						curses can be identified, some astrology based methods also will help to identify, like the Astamangala Prashana, Avaruda Prashana and Kavade shastra (Cowrie) and many
						more but, if you happen to come across any Siddha yogi he can diagnose this with his Intuitive diagnosis ability without any external support, such methods are always
						appreciated, here at temple the malefic effects will be identified based on the Intuitive intelligence.
					</p>
					<p className="fw-bold fs-5 mt-5">What are the symptoms or effects of the Dosha?</p>
					<p>
						There are many symptoms like the snakes might appear in your dreams as if chasing or biting or you can see a ferocious snake often, then they often see images of dead
						people or ancestors, some kind of fear is generated in their dreams, some may also suffer from aero acrophobia – the fear of higher places or fear in lonely places,
						some face issues like schizophrenia, hallucination and delusion, some even literally get attacked by an eagle.{" "}
					</p>
					<p className="fw-bold fs-5 mt-5">The effects are as followed </p>
					<ul className="regular-ul list-none">
						<li>a. The person will face issues related to marriage like delayed marriage, divorce and extra marital affair.</li>
						<li>
							b. One will face issues related to health which most of the time cannot be medically diagnosed, skin related problems appear, head ache- migraine type but with no
							physical and mental disability.
						</li>
						<li>
							c. Some face issues related to luck and efforts as they may not get proper results as per their hard work or efforts in their profession and in the business or with
							the partners.
						</li>
						<li>d. Some have to face issues related to children in one's life like difficulty in baring a child, miscarriage, abortions and</li>
						<li>
							e. others will have bad conduct children, children will regularly cause issues, hyperactivities, misbehaviour with parents & elders, Friends of Bad company, attached
							to the Bad habits, drop in their academics and children with learning disabilities and many more{" "}
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Here I have mentioned few effects, there are many that follow.</p>
					<p className="fw-bold fs-5 mt-5">Then how to clear the Dosha?</p>
					<p>There are many methods that are followed in our country mainly three types, they are as follows </p>
					<p>The first is Vaidic method, second is tantric method and the third is the sacred traditional Sidda method.</p>
					<p>
						Under Vaidic method rituals like Sarpa samskara, Naga Bali, Ashlesha Bali and many more in Tantric method some rituals related with Chakra puja, Talismans and some
						rituals and lastly rituals at Ceremonial grounds are practiced the third one is difficult but very effective in results, concerned with Holy medicine/Prasada prepared
						from the rare herbs and administered along with small rituals and mantras, this method is a traditional Sidda method.{" "}
					</p>
					<p className="fw-bold fs-5 mt-5">Which method do you follow?</p>
					<p>
						At the Temple we follow the third method of worship and remedies which is the Traditional Sidda method that includes Holy medicine preparations made from rare herbs
						extracted with mantra and rituals being followed, every month we enrol only 10 People for remedy (Parihara) puja.{" "}
					</p>
					<p className="fw-bold fs-5 mt-5">How to contact?</p>
					<p>Sri Prasad guruji will meet general public every Tuesday’s afternoon at the temple</p>
					<p>He listens to their problems and he gives counselling and remedies for the problems, any one can meet him irrespective of cast, creed and religion.</p>
					<p>For those wanting to meet personally can book an appointment, you can call or WhatsApp on +91 99000 22506 </p>

					<h2 className="text-center  fw-bold display-5 mb-5 ">A logical question which strikes every mind</h2>
					<ul className="award-ul">
						<li>
							<p className="text-black fw-bold fs-5">Question: While modern medicine takes days to cure sickness, can few minutes of ritual cure malefic effects?</p>
							<hr />
							<p className="mt-4">
								<b>Answer:</b> I do agree with you, it's a common question that arises in the mind, when we fall sick or get infection, Doctors administer antimicrobial treatment
								for 7 to 9 days, medicines being intellectually prepared involve lot of studies and research to treat diseases, it becomes unbelievable to accept that 30 minutes or
								3 hrs of rituals can clear the diseases caused from malefic effects, these questions nonetheless arouse the mind and so it definitely will not work for people who
								do not believe in faith or ritual based methods. Science has nourished minds by laying profound impact on bringing cure for diseases through research based chemical
								concoctions, similarly cures based of Faith science (Belief system- Ritual based) is always appreciated by those who have faith in God and the rituals that follow,
								it does not work for the conditioned mind, the educated having developed the sense of analysis and judgement, for such people faith-based remedy /Parihara does not
								work, while curing disease is the ultimate factor, analysing and arriving at their cause is another be it hereditary, contracted or that caused by the placement of
								planets in the natal chart which causes malefic effects.

							<p className="mt-4">
								<b>Answer:</b> I personally suggest you take up the method i have mentioned above, it is the Traditional Siddha method which includes Holy medicine(Prasada)
