					<p>
						“Sukha or Happiness” is the one thing that every person in this world strives for. Every action of human being is directly or indirectly aimed at achieving happiness.
						There are two ways a person can live his life. He can either spend his whole life pursuing desires, ambitions and happiness in the external sensory world or he can
						turn-away from the sensory world which is temporary in a search for the eternal ever-lasting bliss, the two ways of living life, one is the progressive way and the
						other is the way of renunciation.
					</p>

					<p>
						The Vedas have ordained two paths, Pravritti and Nivritti, to guide the active life of people, both as an individual pursuing spiritual goal and as a member in a social
						set up. Both paths are meant to lead to salvation. Pravritti dharma entails one to follow the worldly path and seek salvation, while Nivritti dharma is rooted in
						renunciation of the worldly aims. Both are meant to serve the needs of people born with inherent tendencies to either lead a life of action or of contemplation.
					</p>

					<p>
						In other words, Pravritti pertains to 'ashrama' dharma and is the path shown by sages Marichi, Atri, Angiras and others. Nivritti is the path of renunciation and the
						jnana marga that the Sanatkumara sages exemplify. Those upholding Pravritti marga have been created to lead a life to propagate the race; but still they lead
						disciplined lives and realize God by discharging the ordained duties in a detached and selfless manner without any personal gain or expectation. It is shown that Karma
						by itself cannot lead to salvation; but in the process of doing one's karma one attains chitta suddhi and gains jnana by which he/she is likely to attain salvation.
					</p>

					<p>
						"SRI" is the workshop specially designed for those, who lead a life of Pravrithi Dharma or the progressive way of living or the house holders, from the workshop one
						will get the ability and the knowledge to attain success, achievements and lead holistic life, SRI is meant to serve the needs of people born with inherent tendencies
						to lead a happy, healthy, wealthy and successful life when it is said wealthy and healthy, the wealth doesn't mean only money, wealth is so much more than money, True
						wealth is the ability to live life on your own terms. It's freedom briefly describing the significance of the two concepts for your understanding. Wealth refers to the
						stock of assets held by a person or household at a single point in time, Income refers to money received by a person or household over some period of time, but both are
						needed to lead a progressive life.
					</p>

					<p>
						In the spiritual world, money is energy and money has power. Like all other forces such as wind and fire money also is subjected to certain Universal laws and
						principles. Once we understand these laws and align our thoughts and actions accordingly, we open the doors to Wealth, Money and Prosperity for us and that too in
						Abundance, SRI is the solution.
					</p>

					<p>
						Most of us have been brought up with the importance of hard work, intelligence, education and other good factors for earning money and being successful. However, by
						experience we can say that certain other factors also play very important role in determining the amount of money we will have – no matter how good is the Investment,
						Financial Planning or the Wealth Management.
					</p>

					<p>
						The ways of attracting wealth and money are followed, they have a propensity to instantly attract money from the infinite source, defy our normal understanding of cause
						and effect. It goes beyond what is logical and rationally possible. Such miraculous and abundant results are indications of the wondrous phenomenon of “manifestation”.
					</p>

					<p>There is a good ancient time tested yogic method of attracting abundant wealth, possible through Mantra, Yantra and Tantra</p>

					<p>
						The whole Universe contains sounds like Mantras and which functions with Yantra/ Machine and the system or Tantra/technic. In other words the total universe is based on
						Mantra, Tantra and Yantra and is inseparable from them. It is the beauty behind the Yogic practice; the aesthetic sense ; scientific functionality and general and
						spiritual philosophy behind them.

					<p className="fs-5 fw-bold">Mantra :</p>
					<p>
						Is a universal sound, so a mantra is not something that you utter. It is something that you strive to become because unless you become the key, existence will not open
						up for you. Becoming the mantra means you are becoming the key. Only if you are the key you can open the lock.
					</p>

					<p className="fs-5 fw-bold">Yantra :</p>
					<p>
						A yantra literally means a gadget or a machine. A gadget or a machine is a combination of very purposeful forms. For example, while we have to multiply two big numbers,
						we reach for a calculator – a yantra. It is not that the calculation is not possible in the mind, but this purposeful form or yantra allows us to use our body in a much
						better way.
					</p>

					<p className="fs-5 fw-bold">Tantra :</p>
					<p>
						The word “tantra” literally means a technique or a technology. This is an inner technology. These are subjective methods not objective methods. It is just that certain
						aspects are used in a certain way. It is not any different from yoga. It is a limb of yoga called tantra yoga.
					</p>

					<p className="fs-5 fw-bold">Mudra :</p>
					<p>
						We use these gestures in meditation or in pranayama practice to direct the flow of energy within the body by using the hands. So when we place our hands in yogic
						mudras, we stimulate different areas of the brain and create a specific energy circuit in the body.
					</p>

					<p>
						Bringing prosperity, riches and happiness into your life is not difficult when you are doing it one-step at a time. In fact, the easiest way to see results is to begin
						with one thing. Here is a Ancient yogic way of attracting wealth through easy strategies or method that will help you establish and to attract wealth and prosperity,
						greater riches and happiness in your lifetime and the effective and supportive tips from Vastu, wealth attracting plants, aromas and many more.
					</p>

					<p>
						Are you ready to get started? Remember, using the Mantra , Yantra and Tantra to attract wealth into your life is not a quick fix solution. Furthermore, the key to
						success in any practice is patience and consistency. If you are not persistent and working daily to achieve your goals you will have little success. Although, those who
						are persistent and won’t accept failure as an option will eventually succeed.
					</p>

					<p>

						yoga tantra methods.
